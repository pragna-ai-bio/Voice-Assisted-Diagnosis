# 🔬 PragnaAI: Parkinson's Disease Voice Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains the front-end user interface for the PragnaAI system, a research application designed for the voice-based analysis and preliminary detection of Parkinson's Disease metrics. The dashboard provides a modern, responsive interface for recording voice samples, visualizing audio metrics, and displaying model diagnostic results.

# ✨ Features

The dashboard is structured around four main real-time data cards, providing a complete overview of the diagnostic process:

Voice Recording & Playback: Features controls for starting and stopping a voice recording session, along with a mock timer and playback function.

Analysis Results: Displays the diagnostic confidence percentage via a clean progress circle, indicating whether the analysis is complete or pending.

Voice Analysis Graph: A visualization component with interactive tabs to switch between Waveform, Spectrum, and Pitch analysis views (currently placeholders for future integration).

Model Information: A static sidebar providing key details about the underlying Machine Learning model, including the training data source, algorithm used, and reported accuracy.

# 🛠️ Technology Stack

This application is built using a modern, efficient, and component-based technology stack:

React: Used for building a robust and maintainable component-based user interface.

Tailwind CSS: Provides utility-first styling for rapid development of a responsive, dark-themed, and aesthetically pleasing design.

Lucide React: Used for sharp, modern, and easily scalable icons.
